Self-Evaluation for Genetic Programming
Spring 2013

This project has been one of the most valuable learning experiences across all 
of our classes this semester. It tested not only our knowledge of python, but
our ability to implement new concepts and interpret math and the world in a
pythonic way. What started as a project to implement an existing python module
 in an interesting way quickly led to the creation of our own "module" for 
CoEvolving two 1D genomes. One of the things we’re most proud of is having 
created this CoEvolution system ourselves, as it is something not available 
online at this point. We forged a new path by ourselves.

A problem we encountered is that the Fourier series we implemented did not 
produce intelligible results as we had hoped. When running various simulations,
we saw that the predator did not follow the prey nor strategize to catch the 
prey at all. It became clear that the predator’s behavior was rather random. 
Therefore we replaced this portion of the program with a more structured 
mathematical equation that produces the desired results. If we had more time 
on the project, we would research more into finding a more generalized 
solution for the prey and predator.

The team was very happy when we saw that the coevolution was functioning 
properly. We know the program is running accordingly when the prey and predator
take turns in winning each simulation. The intent of the program had been to 
make the prey and predator depend on each other. Therefore if the prey is 
performing well, the predator is programmed to evolve to be better in the 
next generation. And vice versa.
