Our Software Design project includes the following python scripts:
 
BestCoEvolve.py - The main function which utilizes all the other python scripts
LogReader.py - Converts log of data into a graph of scores over generations
crossOver.py - Creates two new genomes by combining parent genomes
fitSim.py - The fitness function that runs predator/prey competitions and scores them
genome.py - The genome object class
initialPop.py - Creates the initial population of genomes
mutations.py - This generates random mutation in an inputted genome
predPreyForces.py - This function generates a new force vector over every time step
predPreySim.py - This runs the predator vs prey simulation
selector.py - This function picks the parents of the next generation
testCoEvolve.py - This function runs an easy application of our CoEvolve programs
visualization.py - This generates the visual of predator and prey simulations
TestFitnessFunctions.py - This is the fitness function for testCoEvolve.py

Documentation includes the follow txt files:

UserGuide.txt - outlines how to use the program
DesignGuide.txt - summarizes function of the entire program
InstallationGuide.txt - outlines required tools
Self-Evaluation.txt - reflection on the project
VideoPictureInfo.txt - explains the video and picture files
