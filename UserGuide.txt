User Guide for GeneticProgramming
Spring 2013

This project incorporates genetic algorithms to simultaneously evolve two species. 
This idea of genetic programming can be used to solve light problems that require 
many test iterations. In order to see the results of our program, the user runs the 
BestCoEvolve.py script. This will generate thousands of generations of evolution 
data. In order to visualize the logged data, the user can run the testrun function 
within the fitSim.py script with the arguments as follows: predator, prey, True 
(signifying the desire for animation), True (signifying you want the animation 
to be saved as an mp4).
