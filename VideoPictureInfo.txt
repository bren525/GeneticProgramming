1000Gen.png shows a graph of Predator best scores(red), Prey best scores
(green), and average population scores across the first 1000 generations.
Predators are looking for low scores while prey are looking for high scores,
so whether the graph is close to its minimum or maximum tells you which
population is outperforming the other at each generation. We were extremely
happy with our results, you can see that the scores do not converge, no
predator or prey is even unbeatable, the graph oscillates back and forth
as they vie for dominance.

The Sampled0-330.mp4 shows testruns between the best predator and
prey from every tenth generation starting at 0 and going through 330.
Several interesting points to not while watching this sample. We can
see from generations 150-200 the predator dominates, this is paralled
on our score graph (1000Gen.png) as you can see the low scores for
these generations. This period is followed by a period of prey domination
from generation 220-250 the prey uses a similar circular pattern to 
constantly evade the predator who lags behind. At generation 260 you
can see a clear shift in predator strategy as it decides to cut through
the curve of the prey as opposed to folowing the outside of the curve.

The Sample80-120.mp4 shows every generation's best pred vs prey testrun
between generations 80 and 120. You can see more closely the changes that
occur, again reflecting the score graph (1000Gen.png). The video seems
repetitive, showcasing how successful strategies are passed on and better
strategies take time to evolve.
